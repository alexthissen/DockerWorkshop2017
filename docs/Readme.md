# Workshop Sela Developer Practice 
## Architecting .NET solutions in a Docker ecosystem

Welcome to the workshop "Architecting .NET solutions in a Docker ecosystem". 

In this workshop you will create a .NET application that demonstrates what is required to design a solution running in a Docker ecosystem.

To get the best experience with the hands-on-labs it is recommended that you prepare the following:
- Laptop for development and running containers
- Azure subscription to create and use a Docker container cluster

### Preparing for workshop

Even though you can certainly participate in this workshop with an unprepared laptop, it will save a lot of time to install your development machine ahead of time. In [Lab 0 - Getting started](Lab0-GettingStarted.md) you will find a list of the recommended tools to install on your laptop or development Virtual Machine.

Additionally, for hosting a container cluster in Microsoft Azure you will need an Azure subscription. You can create a trial account if you do not have a subscription available.
